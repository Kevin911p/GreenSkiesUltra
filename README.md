The GreenSkies project is a Python-based desktop application designed to raise awareness about the environmental impact of air travel. It calculates flight-related CO₂ emissions using the distance between airports and aircraft-specific emission factors.

The system promotes eco-friendly travel habits by providing emission insights, alternative suggestions, and environmental offset recommendations. Through this, GreenSkies aims to educate travelers and support global sustainability efforts in reducing aviation’s carbon footprint.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Prof. Kuljeet Singh for his continuous guidance, feedback, and encouragement throughout the course of this project.

I am also grateful to CHRIST (Deemed to be University), Delhi NCR, for providing the resources, academic support, and environment necessary to complete this work.

Lastly, I thank my classmates, friends, and family for their unwavering support and motivation.
